# Phonebook
This program is a Computer Science 2 (CS145) project for Prof. Darrell Criss called "Assignment 2: Phonebook" at Whatcom Community College, Spring 2023.

Phonebook is a program to demonstrate a single linked list. This allows us to change modify, add, and delete data from a node, in this way we are able to edit a phonebook log in real time.

This program uses 3 classes:
- PhonebookNode: This is holding the code for a single node in the phonebook linked list, storing the data for the provided strings.
- PhonebookManager: This is handling operations including adding, deleting, modifying, and displaying the phonebook linked list.
- PhonebookTest: This demonstrates the usage of PhonebookManager by adding, printing, modifying, and deleting different entries.

In this way we are able to create a link of nodes, starting at the head and traversing until we run out of nodes to connect to, based on how many people we have data for, called a linked list.

Thank you for checking out my program,
